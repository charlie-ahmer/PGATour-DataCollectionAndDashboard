# PGATour-DataScience
This project aims to analyze the PGA Tour player stats/data from 2017-2022 to gain insights into the players' performance and to build machine learning models for predicting future outcomes.

## Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis

- Collect data from various sources (official PGA Tour website's GraphQL API)
- [View Web Scraping Notebook here](/PGA_WebScrape.ipynb)
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency
- Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data's characteristics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation
- Visualize the data using graphs and charts to identify trends and patterns
- Analyze the relationship between different variables using correlation analysis
- [View EDA Notebook here](/PGA_EDA.ipynb)

## Machine Learning Modeling

- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Build and train several machine learning models, such as random forest, support vector machines, and neural networks
- Evaluate the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Fine-tune the models' hyperparameters to improve their performance
- Select the best-performing model and use it to predict future outcomes

This project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the PGA Tour players' performance and help stakeholders make informed decisions.
